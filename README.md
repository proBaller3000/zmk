# ZMK Firmware: Personal fork

This is my personal ZMK fork containing various experimental features used in
my [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config/). It is regularly rebased
onto the latest upstream.

Note that this branch adds mouse support using the [original mouse
PR)(https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/778) by krikun. Note that due to
some dependency conflicts between the original mouse PR and upstream ZMK, this
main branch won't be updated until pointer movement/scrolling
([#2027](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2027)) is added upstream.

In the meantime, a newer version of this branch that is up to date with the
latest upstream and is based on the new mouse API developed in
[#2027](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2027) is available
[here](https://github.com/urob/zmk/tree/main-with-native-mouse).

Below is a list of features currently included in the `main` branch _on top of_
